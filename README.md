# Django REST Envelop

Turn the ViewSet list endpoints to return an object rather than a list directly.

## Installation

From PYPi using `pip`:

```
pip install django-rest-envelope
```

## Usage

In your viewset views, you can use the `ListEnvelopeMixin` along with another mixin that defines the `list()` method:

```python
class MyViewSet(ListEnvelopeMixin, ReadOnlyModelViewSet):
    envelope = "my_envelope"
```

In your ViewSet class that uses the mixin you have to define the `envelope` attribute.

Additionally, you can overwrite the `get_envelope()` method to tweak the behaviour of
which envelope use in different situations.

### Example

By default, django REST ViewSets return a list:

```json
[
  { "id": 1, "foo": "bar" },
  { "id": 2, "foo": "baz" }
]
```

Once the mixin is applied to that same ViewSet, you get, instead, the following response:

```json
{
  "my_envelope": [
    { "id": 1, "foo": "bar" },
    { "id": 2, "foo": "baz" }
  ]
}
```
